/**
 * Hono application factory — P4.
 *
 * Wiring order is contract order:
 *   1. compose the studio context (store plugins + bus + injected runtime);
 *   2. register all 39 contract endpoints and assert full coverage;
 *   3. `/api/*` fallback = 404 JSON (an unknown API path must NEVER fall
 *      through to the static/SPA handler);
 *   4. static files + SPA fallback from the read-only Vite build.
 *
 * The engine is injected: `opts.runtime` is a `RuntimeAdapter` (or a factory
 * over the composed stores, which is what the REAL adapter needs to resolve
 * session directories AND the provider target). With nothing injected the app
 * mounts the real runtime (`runtime/`) wired to the real LLM, so the default
 * deployment is the engine over a live provider, not a fake; the P4 fake stays
 * available to tests through `harness.test-util.ts`.
 *
 * W743 (W732 A1): the engine assembly itself lives in `createStudioEngine()`
 * below — the ONE factory — and `defaultRuntime()` is just the production
 * binding of its injected values. The real-engine test harness
 * (`runtime/test-util.ts`) calls the same function, so "the tests run the real
 * engine" now also means "the tests run the real grants boundary and the real
 * usage ledger".
