/**
 * `RuntimeAdapter` — the ONE seam between the Studio host and the engine.
 *
 * P4 ships the Hono layer plus the data stores; the real runtime
 * (`packages/runtime` compose + agent-loop + llm + tools) lands on a separate
 * workstream. Everything the engine owns is therefore expressed here as an
 * injected interface, and P4 verifies the contract against a fake adapter:
 *
 *   POST /api/turn                     -> startTurn() / inject()  (W513: a busy
 *                                         session takes an interjection instead
 *                                         of a 409; the turn is never restarted)
 *   GET  /api/events                   -> attach(bus)   (the adapter emits,
 *                                         one envelope per session)
 *   POST /api/cancel                   -> cancel(session)
 *   POST /api/clear                    -> clear(session)
 *   POST /api/sessions/{id}/activate   -> ensureSession(id)  (W513: never 409)
 *   POST /api/sessions/{id}/compact    -> compact(session)
 *   GET  /api/status                   -> statusline(session?) + isBusy(session?)
 *   GET  /api/tools                    -> tools()
 *   GET  /api/sessions/{id}/context    -> sessionContext(session)  (W725)
 *   GET+POST /api/config               -> profile() / configure(patch)
 *   POST /api/worker/{spawn,send}      -> workerSpawn() / workerSend()
 *   GET  /api/worker/status            -> workerStatus(wid?)
 *   GET  /api/sessions (worker rows)   -> workerSessions()
 *   GET  /api/sessions/worker:<sid>/…  -> workerMessages(sid)
 *
 * W513 (session independence): busy, turn numbering, status/usage trackers and
 * the session inbox are PER SESSION. `isBusy()` with no argument keeps the
 * legacy "is anything running" reading for the handlers that guard process-wide
 * operations; every session-scoped handler passes the target session id.
 *
 * Replacing the fake with the real runtime is a one-line change in
 * `createStudioApp({ runtime })` — no handler changes, no route changes.
