/**
 * W782 — the deployment facts the system prompt is allowed to state, and the
 * ONE place each of them is written down.
 *
 * Why this module exists. The `environment` prompt section (order 200) used to
 * spell out this checkout's absolute paths BY HAND:
 *
 *   "…the TypeScript service in <repo> (Hono, systemd unit
 *    <service> on <bind>; public site <site>).
 *    … the frontend is <repo>/apps/web …"
 *
 * The same fact therefore existed TWICE and independently: once in the real
 * deployment (the systemd unit, the config, this checkout) and once as prose in
 * a prompt template. Nothing tied them together, so when the repo moved
 * (`celestea_studio` -> `celestea_studio-ts`), when the frontend was merged in
 * (`frontend/` -> `apps/web`) and when the data dir moved out of the tree
 * (W781), the template had to be edited by hand each time — and a forgotten edit
 * makes the agent confidently describe a layout that no longer exists. W768 was
 * exactly that failure (`pwd` was one workspace while the prompt named another).
 *
 * The rule this module enforces: **derive what can be derived, and keep the one
 * irreducible literal in a single named constant.** The template may only
 * reference `{{...}}` variables; `apps/studio/src/store/prompts.test.ts` fails
 * the build if an absolute path literal ever reappears in a template string.
 *
 * Derivation precedence, per fact:
 *   repo root   <- this file's own location, walked up to the workspace marker
 *                  (never the cwd, never an env var, never a literal)
 *   frontend    <- repo root + apps/web
 *   static root <- `config.paths.staticRoot` (already an operator setting)
 *   bind        <- `config.bind` (already an operator setting)
 *   unit name   <- CELESTEA_SERVICE_NAME ?? /proc/self/cgroup ?? [SERVICE_FALLBACK]
 *   public site <- CELESTEA_PUBLIC_SITE ?? [PUBLIC_SITE_DEFAULT] (irreducible:
 *                  nothing in this process knows which DNS name the
 *                  tunnel/Nginx answers on — so the OPERATOR sets it, and the
 *                  fallback is a neutral placeholder, never a real hostname)
