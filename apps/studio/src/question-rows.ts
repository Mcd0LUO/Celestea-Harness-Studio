/**
 * W783 §7 — the two session-log rows of the user-question feature.
 *
 * WHY THEY EXIST AT ALL: `tool_result` has no `decision` field, so a question's
 * state would otherwise live only in an SSE frame and vanish on reload. These
 * rows are the durable record: a reconnecting client rebuilds the card from
 * `user_question`, and a replay can tell "the user answered" from "the clock ran
 * out" by finding (or not finding) the matching `user_answer`.
 *
 * WHAT THEY ARE NOT: model-visible history. Both projections SKIP them, because
 * the model already receives the outcome as the ordinary `tool_result` of
 * `ask_user_question` — projecting them too would invent a second copy of the
 * same decision and break the tool_call/tool_result pairing.
 *
 * The row shape is additive (W783 §7.2): a reader that does not know these two
 * types treats them exactly like any other unknown row — a torn tail.
