/**
 * W860: session-level TOOL SWITCHES — the pure SUBTRACTIVE layer beside the W9
 * permission baseline.
 *
 * A session may DISABLE tools by name (`<session dir>/tools.json`). The list is
 * a DENY set ONLY: `engine-grants.ts` unions it with the preset's `toolDeny`
 * (preset first, session second) into the session's effective deny, so the engine
 * can never turn a blocked name back on — including the names the `execution`
 * mode folded away. Nothing here ever ADDS a tool (grants' `tool_extra` is the
 * only additive path, and it is unaffected by this file).
 *
 * Same discipline as permission.json: whitelist + validate every field, atomic
 * 0600 write, and a corrupt / foreign file means "run as if nothing were
 * disabled" — never "repair it". That is deliberately fail-closed for the DENY
 * side: an unreadable list must never silently WIDEN the tool face.
