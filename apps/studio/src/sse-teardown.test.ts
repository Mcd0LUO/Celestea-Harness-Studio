/**
 * W1484 · SSE teardown: is the studio's \`GET /api/events\` an upgraded socket?
 *
 * The question comes from the DSH reference implementation
 * (\`packages/host/webserver/src/index.ts\`): Node's
 * \`server.closeAllConnections()\` does NOT include sockets that were upgraded
 * (101 Switching Protocols), so DSH hand-tracks \`upgradedSockets\` and destroys
 * them one by one — without that, the teardown hangs forever.
 *
 * This suite answers the same question for the studio, mechanically, over a REAL
 * socket (no mocked \`Request\`/\`Response\`):
 *
 *   A. the response head is \`HTTP/1.1 200\` + chunked — a PLAIN request — and the
 *      real \`startStudioServer().stop()\` (the W742 teardown, unchanged) really
 *      does cut an OPEN SSE stream;
 *   B. the contrast that makes (A) meaningful: with the stream open,
 *      \`server.close()\` alone stays PENDING — \`closeAllConnections()\` is the
 *      load-bearing step. That is the same hang shape DSH works around, here for
 *      a plain GET, which is exactly why no explicit socket tracking is needed;
 *   C. the cut releases the bus subscription (\`stream.onAbort\`), so a teardown
 *      cannot leak subscribers.
 *
 * Ratchet: if \`/api/events\` ever becomes an upgraded socket (a WebSocket-based
 * push, or any transport answering 101), (A) turns red — which is precisely the
 * moment the explicit \`upgradedSockets\` tracking would become necessary.
