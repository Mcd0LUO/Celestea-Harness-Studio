/**
 * SessionComposer — `compose()` for ONE session (W513).
 *
 * Every session runtime is one self-consistent generation: its own profile
 * snapshot (base profile + the session's `session.json` model override), its own
 * session binding (`<dir>/cli-main.jsonl` or an in-memory log when detached),
 * its own usage tracker, its own agent loop instance and its own worker
 * registry. Nothing is shared but the process (and the LLM seam factory), which
 * is exactly what makes two sessions unable to see each other's history.
 *
 * The module also owns the resource caps and the two error channels the host
 * maps onto HTTP 503, so the adapter itself stays about the HTTP contract.
