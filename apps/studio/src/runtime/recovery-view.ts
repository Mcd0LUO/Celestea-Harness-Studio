/**
 * `GET /api/status.recovery` (E §1.3 P1 ②) — the LIVE view of one session's
 * checkpoint, appended to an existing endpoint (P1 adds no endpoint).
 *
 * Every field answers a question the operator could otherwise only answer by
 * reading two files by hand:
 *
 *   - `recovered_turns` — which turns THIS engine had to close after a crash
 *     (the sidecar's `repaired[]`, the durable record of R1-1);
 *   - `dangling_turns`  — how many turns the LOG leaves open right now. It is a
 *     judgement about the log (K4: the log is the truth), so it is counted from
 *     the events, using the same rule as `analyzeReplay().danglingTurns`;
 *   - `unpaired_compaction` — the log's LAST `compaction_start` has no
 *     `compaction_end` after it, i.e. a compaction REWROTE this log and never
 *     finished. Also a judgement about the log (the same `events()`), and the
 *     only surface docs/pitfalls.md P12's failure has ever had: W2020 moved the
 *     closing append to the caller, so "rewrite landed, rebind failed" leaves
 *     the pair open. The pre-compaction history is then gone from the log and
 *     survives only in `cli-main.jsonl.precompact`;
 *   - `degraded`        — the log and the disk forked (`writeErrorCount>0`, G1-6);
 *   - `last_outcome`    — the phase of the LAST `turn_end` in the log, which is
 *     what "was the previous turn interrupted?" really asks.
 *
 * Nothing here composes an instance: a session with no live generation reports
 * the empty block (zeros, no turns) rather than waking an engine for a poll.
 *
 * W2022 — why the empty block answers `unpaired_compaction: false` and not
 * `null`: this block describes the LIVE generation. It reads the sidecar next to
 * a live log, but it never opens a log of its own (the statusline polls this
 * endpoint every 2s; an unbounded log read per poll is load, not a diagnostic),
 * so "no unpaired compaction" is asserted at exactly the strength the sibling
 * `degraded: false` already is. The state becomes visible the moment the session
 * is composed again — which is the moment an operator would look at it.
