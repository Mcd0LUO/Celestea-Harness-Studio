/**
 * Boot observation of the studio's own worker table (E §2.3 P0 ③).
 *
 * The startup sequence is: read the table this studio wrote in an earlier life →
 * judge every row (dead owner? missing host session?) → write ONE audit line per
 * finding plus one summary line → report on stderr.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: re-dispatch, settle, or rewrite a row. That
 * is the whole P0/P2 split — acting on a stale row before the tool
 * side-effect table exists turns "crash recovery" into a side-effect amplifier
 * (§5.1), and the DSH-side plugin is already the owner of liveness actions for
 * its own fleet. P0 only makes the situation VISIBLE, in three places:
 *
 *   1. `<data dir>/recovery-audit.jsonl` (the durable record);
 *   2. `GET /api/worker/status` → `stale[]` / `orphans[]` (the live view);
 *   3. `[celestea-worker-recovery]` on stderr (the operator's log).
