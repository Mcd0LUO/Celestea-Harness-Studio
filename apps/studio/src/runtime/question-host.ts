/**
 * W783 — the host's user-question capability in ONE object.
 *
 * Three things have to exist together and must never drift apart:
 *   - the process-wide [QuestionRegistry] (so `POST /api/questions/{id}/answer`
 *     can find a request from its id alone, whichever session asked);
 *   - the [QuestionView] that publishes a parked question on the session's SSE
 *     bus and renders the §7 recovery list;
 *   - the wiring the composer hands to each session generation.
 *
 * Bundling them keeps `real-runtime-adapter.ts` — the engine seam, which has a
 * hard size budget and should stay about the engine — down to a handle and three
 * one-line delegations. The bus and the turn numbering are reached through
 * callbacks, so the adapter stays the only thing that knows how to reach them.
