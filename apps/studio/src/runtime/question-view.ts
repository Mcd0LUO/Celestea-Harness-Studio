/**
 * W783 — the host-side view of the pending-question table.
 *
 * This module is what the HTTP layer talks to: it publishes parked questions on
 * the session's SSE bus, resolves them when the human answers, and renders the
 * §7 recovery list. Keeping it out of `real-runtime-adapter.ts` is not cosmetic —
 * that file is the engine seam and has a hard size budget; more importantly, none
 * of this needs the engine, only the table plus a way to reach the bus.
 *
 * The one thing it deliberately does NOT do is write the `user_answer` log row:
 * the session's own service owns that, because it is the single place that
 * observes EVERY settlement (a real answer and a §6.3 timeout alike).
