/**
 * The two lifecycle operations of ONE session generation — `clear` and `compact`
 * (extracted from `real-runtime-adapter.ts`, W787: the adapter is the HTTP seam
 * and stays inside the §4.1 file budget; the operations themselves are about the
 * session runtime, not about the seam).
 *
 *   - `clearSession` empties the log and resets the turn counter of the LIVE
 *     instance, and 409s (`TurnBusyError`) while a turn is in flight — clearing
 *     a session mid-turn would delete the rows the turn is writing;
 *   - `compactSession` compacts `<dir>/cli-main.jsonl`, and when an instance is
 *     live it is EVICTED first and composed again afterwards: the compaction
 *     rewrites the file behind the log's descriptor, so reusing the old instance
 *     would keep serving the pre-compaction history from memory. W2020: that
 *     rebuild is also what CLOSES the compaction's marker pair — the trailing
 *     `compaction_end` is written only once the rebind succeeded, so a rebind
 *     failure leaves an unpaired `compaction_start` on disk (P12's named
 *     failure, which was invisible while the append lived in `runCompaction`).
 *     W825 P0: when
 *     `evict` REFUSES (a pinned instance with live worker work, or a busy one)
 *     the log is NOT rewritten at all — no orphaned descriptor, no false
 *     `rebound` — and `rebound:true` is reported only for a verified rebuild.
