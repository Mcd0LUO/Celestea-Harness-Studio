/**
 * W857 — a session's permission BASELINE must reach the REPORTED tool face.
 *
 * W9 (read-only / write-read / full-access) applies `toolDeny` twice: the
 * composed instance folds it into its `DisclosurePolicy.blocked`
 * (`engine-plugins.ts`), and `RealRuntimeAdapter.sessionTools` — the seam behind
 * `GET /api/tools?session=` and the settings page's tool list
 * (`handlers/config-shape.ts`) — has to apply the SAME rule (W791 §10.5 #2: the
 * prompt's `{{tools}}`, the HTTP answer and the registry the agent loop really
 * dispatches through are ONE face).
 *
 * Before W857 `sessionTools` only folded the MODE, so a read-only session still
 * reported `write_file` over HTTP while its own instance did not offer it.
 *
 * Level: the REAL adapter (`RealRuntimeAdapter` through `createStudioEngine`), a
 * throwaway data dir and throwaway session dirs. Deliberately NOT an
 * `engineTools` re-derivation: the divergence lived exactly between the composed
 * instance and this adapter path.
