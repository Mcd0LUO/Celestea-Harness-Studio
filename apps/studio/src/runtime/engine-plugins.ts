/**
 * The engine's compose plugins: the `Llm` seam, the tool registry (builtins +
 * the three worker-orchestration tools) and the agent loop.
 *
 * This module exists so `real-runtime-adapter.ts` stays about the HTTP contract:
 * every `Context` service the runtime resolves at turn start is provided here,
 * in one place, with the tool set assembled explicitly (a later `provide` wins,
 * so the host can override any of them by mounting its own plugin).
 *
 * W741 (fixes the W738 §4 finding): the sandbox is **always** chosen by the
 * provider policy — `selectSandboxDetailed`, i.e. bwrap whenever the host can
 * give it, with or without session grants — and the resulting decision travels
 * with every run (`SandboxDecision`). `CELESTEA_SANDBOX_FALLBACK=fail` is read on
 * the default path too and it REFUSES to execute (structured `SandboxError`)
 * instead of degrading to the userspace provider behind the operator's back.
