/**
 * `POST /api/exec` (iteration G2) — run a shell command NOW, with no model in
 * the loop. `/run <cmd>` and `!<cmd>` are the UI's callers.
 *
 * Three rules from `docs/archive/decisions/iteration-g-workbench.md` §1:
 *   1. it reuses the run_shell execution path — the SAME `selectSandboxDetailed`
 *      policy, `sessionSandboxConfig` (workdir/root), `sanitizedEnv` allowlist
 *      and output cap the engine's `run_shell` uses, so isolation cannot fork;
 *   2. it passes the PERMISSION gate: a preset that denies `run_shell` (403), or
 *      a sandbox policy that refuses to execute (400), is a structured refusal —
 *      never a silent run. W9210: the sandbox refusal is answered wherever it
 *      happens, including at SELECTION time (`sandboxFor`), not only from
 *      `sandbox.run`;
 *   3. it is NOT a tool: nothing here touches the model-visible tool face.
 *
 * The `sandbox` block carries ONLY the contract fields (provider / net_isolated
 * / tmp_private / seccomp + optional cpu_sec), never host diagnostics.

 * W9210 (the W9206-37 P0): an omitted id used to mean "no baseline at all".
 * The detached scope reads the DEPLOYMENT default preset, so a caller could
 * skip a restricted session's `toolDeny` just by not naming it (naming the
 * session was a 403; omitting it ran). "Which session does an omitted id mean"
 * already has ONE answer in this host — `active_session`, exactly as
 * `handlers/health.ts` (/api/status, /api/tools) and `handlers/dialog.ts`
 * read it — so this function now follows it instead of inventing a second one.
 *
 * A STALE `active_session` (the session it names was deleted) still falls back
 * to the detached scope: it names nothing live, so there is no baseline to
 * apply, and a 404 there would break the legitimate "nothing is focused" case.
 * An id the CALLER supplied is different — that is the caller's own claim, so
 * its failure stays the caller's 404.
 *
 * W1528: exported because the terminal handler resolves its target through the
 * SAME function — a second implementation would be a second answer to "which
 * session's permissions apply", which is exactly the drift this file exists to
 * prevent.
