/**
 * The two user-question endpoints (W783 §9 item 7).
 *
 *   GET  /api/questions                  → every question still answerable
 *   POST /api/questions/{id}/answer      → the human's answer
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWER IS NOT `POST /api/turn`: while the model's `ask_user_question`
 * call is parked, the session's turn slot is occupied. A message posted to
 * `/api/turn` is therefore accepted as STEERING, and steering is only drained at
 * a step boundary — a boundary the parked call never reaches (§2.2). Sending the
 * answer here instead resolves the pending promise the tool is awaiting, so the
 * tool wakes with an ordinary result and the turn continues (§4.2).
 *
 * The `GET` exists for §7 recovery: the `question` SSE frame can be missed (a
 * reload, a dropped connection), so the list is the authoritative rebuild source.
 * Every timing field is judged at READ time, so the client never trusts its own
 * clock and a long-disconnected tab cannot resurrect an expired question.
