/**
 * W1528 — `POST /api/terminal`, `POST /api/terminal/{id}/input`,
 * `POST /api/terminal/{id}/close` (the real-PTY face of the workbench terminal).
 *
 * ## The three rules this handler inherits from `exec.ts` (G2)
 *
 *   1. **The same permission gate.** A preset whose `toolDeny` contains
 *      `run_shell` denies the terminal too — `shellDeniedReason()` is the ONE
 *      reader of that decision, so the UI cannot disagree with what a turn would
 *      allow. A denied open is a structured 403 (`code=shell_denied`), never a
 *      bare run.
 *   2. **The same execution boundary.** `sandboxFor()` picks the provider
 *      exactly as the engine does (provider policy + session scope + grants), so
 *      the pty lives inside bwrap when bwrap is the posture. This file never
 *      spawns anything itself: the only process it can start is the one
 *      `sandbox.spawn()` starts.
 *   3. **Not a tool.** Nothing here touches the model-visible tool face
 *      (`contracts/tools.json` is untouched).
 *
 * ## Output channel: SSE, not polling
 *
 * Bytes go out on the `terminal` SSE event (the contract's 10th name), keyed by
 * `{id, session, data}`. SSE was chosen over a polling endpoint because a pty
 * is a STREAM: polling would either drop bytes between ticks or need a cursor
 * protocol duplicating what the bus already does. The bus is lossy under
 * back-pressure BY CONTRACT (it emits a `lagged` status instead of blocking),
 * which is the honest behaviour for a terminal — the alternative is a slow
 * client stalling the child's output pipe.
 *
 * ## Input channel: HTTP, because SSE is one-way
 *
 * `POST /api/terminal/{id}/input` writes the raw body bytes to the child's stdin
 * **verbatim** — no newline is appended, because the Enter key is a byte the
 * terminal client sends (`\r`), not something the server should invent. That is
 * what makes a REPL work: the same endpoint carries `p`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `t`,
 * `\r` and then the next line.
