/**
 * W1528 — real-PTY plumbing for the workbench terminal.
 *
 * ## Why a `script(1)` shim and not a native PTY
 *
 * Node has no PTY API. The alternatives were a native addon (node-pty: a
 * compiled dependency, a rebuild per Node ABI, and a supply-chain surface this
 * repo does not take lightly) or an EXISTING setuid-free binary that already
 * allocates a pty. `util-linux`'s `script(1)` is the second: it opens
 * `/dev/ptmx`, forks the command onto the slave side, and relays the master to
 * its own stdio. Measured on this host: a prompt appears, `python3` starts a
 * REPL, `top` renders, and `cat` echoes a typed line.
 *
 * ## The sandbox is NOT bypassed
 *
 * The command string built here is handed to the SAME `Sandbox.spawn()` the
 * engine's `run_shell background:true` uses, under the SAME permission gate
 * (`shellDeniedReason`) and the SAME provider selection (`sandboxFor`), so the
 * pty lives INSIDE bwrap. Verified live: `bwrap … -- /usr/bin/script -qfc …`
 * prints a prompt and `tty` answers `/dev/pts/0` (a pty inside the namespace,
 * not the host's).
 *
 * ## What this module deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * - **No shell of its own.** There is no `spawn` call here; the only process
 *   this file can start is the one `sandbox.spawn` starts.
 * - **No resize.** `script(1)` owns the pty MASTER; the host holds pipes to
 *   script's stdio and cannot issue `TIOCSWINSZ`. The size is therefore fixed
 *   when the terminal opens, and the command sets it once via `stty`. A resize
 *   is a re-open — the UI does exactly that, and says so.
 * - **No silent platform fallback.** A host without `script(1)` (Windows) gets a
 *   structured refusal, never a bare shell pretending to be a terminal.
