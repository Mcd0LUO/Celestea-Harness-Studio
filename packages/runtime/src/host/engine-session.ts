/**
 * Engine-side session binding helpers.
 *
 * The host owns the id space (`<workspace>/<session>`); the engine owns the
 * file name: every session directory holds ONE append-only `cli-main.jsonl`
 * (`celestea_studio/src/workspaces.rs` SESSION_FILE), so the log is always
 * opened under the fixed session id `cli-main` and never under the host id —
 * otherwise `file_name_for` would sanitize `ws/s1` into `ws_s1.jsonl` and the
 * engine would talk to a file the host never reads.
 *
 * When nothing is active (or the id is unknown) the generation runs on an
 * in-memory log: `/api/turn` still works, and the adapter never invents a
 * directory on behalf of the operator.
 *
 * E §1.3 P0 ②: a persistent log is wrapped in a checkpoint decorator, so every
 * `turn_start`/`turn_end` it records also updates `<dir>/checkpoint.json`. An
 * in-memory (detached) session has no directory and therefore no sidecar.
 *
 * W747: moved verbatim from `apps/studio/src/runtime/engine-session.ts` into the
 * runtime's host layer (behaviour, export names and log format unchanged; the old
 * path is now a re-export shim). The only edit is the import of the intra-package
 * session binding (`../session-binding.js` instead of the `@celestea/runtime`
 * alias, which would be a package self-cycle). `sessionIdOfDir` came with it, out
 * of the host's grants reader (`engine-grants.ts`), because the id space is what
 * this module already documents; the old path re-exports it unchanged.
