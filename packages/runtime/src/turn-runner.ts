/**
 * One turn, driven through the `AgentLoop` seam (`runtime/src/run.rs`).
 *
 * Responsibilities, in order:
 *   1. **single concurrency slot** — a Runtime generation runs at most one turn;
 *      a second `runTurn` while busy is a [TurnBusyError] (409), never a queue;
 *   2. **receipt drain** — pending worker receipts are polled out of the host
 *      mailbox and appended to the session log BEFORE the input, so a receipt is
 *      real, model-visible history on the host's next turn (W232);
 *   3. **stream mapping** — every `LoopEvent` the loop emits is fed to the
 *      statusline tracker and mapped to one host frame, in log order;
 *   4. **cancel propagation** — the caller's `AbortSignal` is linked to the
 *      turn's own signal, which is (a) passed to the loop bindings and
 *      (b) provided on the turn scope under `TURN_ABORT_SERVICE`;
 *   5. **terminal state** — read back from the session log's own `turn_end`
 *      (the log is the single source of truth), never invented by the runtime.
 *   6. **usage ledger observation** (W728) — when a ledger is wired, the turn
 *      boundary is announced to it (pure observation; it can never throw).
