/**
 * The composed runtime engine: one generation's services, wired and ready.
 *
 * A [Runtime] is deliberately thin — it owns the handles and the lifecycle and
 * delegates turn driving to [TurnRunner]:
 *
 *   - **turn driving**  `runTurn(input, {signal, sink})`, single concurrency slot;
 *   - **statusline**    `statusline()` reads the live tracker + usage accounting;
 *   - **rebinding**     `rebind(binding)` re-opens the SAME session directory;
 *   - **shutdown**      idempotent, re-entrant teardown (drivers, host process
 *                       hooks, mailbox, registries): calling it twice is a
 *                       no-op, and a concurrent caller awaits the same promise;
 *   - **release**       explicit strong-reference drop for hot swaps (W248).
 *
 * `shutdown` also marks the session's checkpoint sidecar as cleanly closed
 * (E §1.3 P0 ⑤), so the next boot can tell a graceful exit from a crash.
 *
 * [release] nulls every handle, which — together with the WeakRef the worker
 * tools hold on the registry — breaks the
 * `Runtime -> ctx -> ToolRegistry -> worker tool -> registry` cycle, so a
 * swapped-out generation can actually be collected.
