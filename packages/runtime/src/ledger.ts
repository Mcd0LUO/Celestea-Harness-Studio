/**
 * Cost & usage ledger (iteration E §3 P0, W728) — append-only, step granularity.
 *
 * One JSON line per model step in `<data dir>/usage-ledger.jsonl`, plus one
 * `turn_total` line per turn for reconciliation. The file is the durable,
 * never-rewritten record of what was spent: the in-memory usage tracker is
 * reset by every generation rebuild (§3.1 G3-1), the ledger is not.
 *
 * Discipline (all mechanical, see the §3.4 assertions):
 *   - append-only: a line is written once and never edited (no rewrite, no
 *     compaction). Rotation (§3.3 P1 ④, W785) rolls the WHOLE file to
 *     `<path>.1` once it passes [USAGE_LEDGER_MAX_BYTES]: the current file is
 *     still only ever appended to, and `read()` reads the current file only
 *     (the CUMULATIVE views call `readAll()`, which prefixes the rolled `.1`);
 *   - one `writeSync` on an `O_APPEND` fd per record, mode 0600, so concurrent
 *     writers cannot interleave a line;
 *   - idempotent: the key is `(session, turn_id, step, attempt)`; a key already
 *     booked by THIS writer is skipped, never rewritten. The key set is
 *     per-process ON PURPOSE: seeding it from the file would silently drop
 *     legitimate out-of-turn rows, whose turn_id is null and whose step index
 *     restarts at 1 after a restart (cross-process dedupe is still open work;
 *     rotation does not change it, §3.3);
 *   - no prompt/message text and no credential can reach a line: a record is
 *     built from counters, names and prices only (§3.5 R3-4);
 *   - observation only: a write failure is reported on stderr and swallowed —
 *     bookkeeping must never change request behaviour (§3.5 R3-3).
 *
 * WHERE a step is observed: `packages/llm`'s `LlmError.httpStatus/retryable`
 * (W723) is only visible at the `Llm` seam, and so are the step boundaries — a
 * stream that tears AFTER a usage frame is ONE error row, not an ok row plus an
 * error row (§3.2.3). [createLedgerLlm] therefore drives `beginStep` → one
 * `record` per usage frame → `close` at the stream's terminal event, while the
 * turn boundaries come from the runtime's [TurnLedgerHooks]. [UsageLedger]
 * still implements the runtime's structural `UsageAccounting` seam, and its
 * `latest`/`total` views are derived from the FILE, so they survive a restart.
