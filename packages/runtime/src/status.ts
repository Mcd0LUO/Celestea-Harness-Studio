/**
 * Statusline tracker — port of `celestea_studio/src/main.rs:253-330` (W218/W263).
 *
 * Two live counters, fed by the turn sink:
 *   - `steps`     one per tool CALL (its `tool_result` closes that step, so a
 *                 result never doubles the count — W263 semantics, equal to the
 *                 frontend's per-turn tool counter);
 *   - `rate`      the `tokens_per_sec` estimate over text/thinking deltas: the
 *                 5s sliding-window rate (W754) while the window still carries
 *                 output, else the mean over the turn's ACTIVE intervals (W763).
 *                 W1467: the NUMERATOR is a token estimate, not a character
 *                 count — see the unit note below.
 *
 * W754 rate semantics (the window half): the rate averages over ACTIVE intervals
 * only. Two deltas farther apart than `GAP_MS` (1s) bound a no-flow break (long
 * tool call, rate limit stall, idle tail of a finished turn), and that break is
 * NOT part of the denominator — a wall-clock span over the whole window would
 * otherwise dilute the rate towards zero. The denominator is the sum of the
 * per-interval spans, each floored at `MIN_ACTIVE_MS` (1s) so a lone burst
 * cannot report a silly rate.
 *
 * W763 turn semantics (the fallback half): the window answer is the responsive
 * one (an observed stream read 570 -> 1003 -> 760 tok/s), but an EMPTY window —
 * a stall longer than 5s, or the plain end of a turn — used to report 0 and stay
 * there, which the operator rejected. So the window rate is reported only while
 * it is positive; otherwise the rate is the mean over the whole TURN's active
 * intervals ([turnRate]), a stable positive number until the next `beginTurn()`.
 * 0 therefore means exactly one thing: this turn has produced no delta yet (TTFT).
 *
 * Unit note (W1467 — the numerator IS tokens now): W754 changed only the
 * DENOMINATOR and left the numerator as a raw character count, which the
 * frontend rendered as "tok/s" on a ~1:1 assumption. That assumption is wrong
 * for any non-ASCII output: the field has always been named `tokens_per_sec`
 * (frozen contract, never renamed), so the honest fix is to make the numerator
 * match the name.
 *
 * The conversion is [tokensFromBytes] (UTF-8 bytes / 4, rounded up) — the exact
 * arithmetic of [estimateTokens], the estimator the loop's trim budget and the
 * context ring already use (`estimatedContextTokens`), so the statusline's two
 * numbers share ONE token model instead of drifting apart. Samples accumulate
 * BYTES and the single conversion happens at the division, which keeps the
 * result identical to estimating the concatenated window (rounding every small
 * delta up would over-report). The ratio is defensible in both directions:
 *   · English/ASCII is 1 byte per char -> 4 chars per token, which is the
 *     well-known BPE ratio for English prose;
 *   · CJK is 3 bytes per char -> ~1.33 chars per token, close to the real
 *     behaviour of CJK tokenizers (one character is usually one token, and
 *     occasionally two).
 * A scalar chars/s cannot express that difference at all, which is why the
 * conversion happens HERE (where the delta text is still available) rather than
 * in the frontend.
 *
 * W755 context-usage口径 (aligned with the DSH host's `contextPressure`):
 *   1. a provider usage frame has been seen -> `used` = that request's REAL
 *      `prompt_tokens` (input + cache, never output) PLUS the model-visible
 *      growth measured since the sample, so the number answers for the NEXT
 *      request instead of the last one (`projected:true`);
 *   2. no frame yet, but the loop hands back its own assembly -> `used` = the
 *      token estimate of THAT request (system + trimmed history + tool
 *      schemas), never of the raw session log (`assembled_estimate`);
 *   3. neither -> `used` = 0 / `method:"none"`: the UI shows "unknown" rather
 *      than a made-up ratio.
 * The session log's CHARACTER count is never reported as a token count again
 * ([estimatedContextChars] survives as an internal/debug helper only), and a
 * missing context window is reported as `window:0, ratio:0` — the 1,000,000
 * display fallback never enters a ratio (W755, Fix A/B/C).
 *
 * W766: branch 2 reads a MEMOIZED estimate ([AssembledContext]): the runtime
 * derives it once per log state, so an idle session's 2s status tick is a lookup
 * instead of an O(bytes) re-estimate. No口径 value changes — the same function
 * produces the same number, just not on every tick.
 *
 * `now()` is injectable so the rate window is testable without sleeping.
