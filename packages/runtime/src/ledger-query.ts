/**
 * Aggregate views over the append-only usage ledger (iteration E §3.2.4, W785 P1).
 *
 * Two readers, both pure functions of the records a [UsageLedgerFile] hands over,
 * so a restart, a hot swap or a second process cannot change the answer:
 *
 *   - [queryLedger]      — `GET /api/usage/ledger`: the step rows of the ledger,
 *                          filtered (`session`/`since`/`until`) and folded into
 *                          one row per `session` | `turn` | `model` | `day` |
 *                          `day_model` (the last is the day x model cross
 *                          product the usage page's per-model trend needs, W9103);
 *   - [ledgerCostBlock]  — `/api/status.cost`: one session's running total, its
 *                          newest `turn_total` row and how many attempts bought it.
 *
 * `turn_total` rows are DELIBERATELY excluded from every sum: they are the
 * reconciliation convenience of §3.2.1 (they restate the steps of their turn), so
 * counting them would book every token twice. Details stay the only truth.
 * Extraction rows (Phase 1) stay out of the step-folded views but DO count in a
 * session's cost block — out-of-turn spend is still spend.
 *
 * `cost` is `null` — never `0` — when no contributing row carried a cost, and
 * `unpriced_records`/`unpriced_models` name the models the price table could not
 * cover (§3.2.2 rule 3: an unknown price is UNKNOWN, not free).
