/**
 * W252: thinking-delta aggregation.
 *
 * The session log is the replay source of truth, but reasoning streams arrive
 * token by token: one jsonl row per delta would explode the log. Consecutive
 * `thinking` deltas are therefore concatenated into a buffer and flushed only
 * at visible boundaries (text / done / failed / stream end / cancellation), so
 * one contiguous reasoning burst becomes exactly ONE persisted
 * `thinking_delta` row. The live `thinking` event is still emitted per delta —
 * only persistence aggregates.
 *
 * W1510 note: whether to release is the CALLER's decision, because a repetition
 * conviction on the reasoning channel means this buffer holds exactly the
 * degenerate burst and must not be written.
 *
 * W1510 (ported semantics): the buffer is a bounded FIFO, not one growing
 * string. The guard can only convict AFTER the degeneration began, so on the
 * fallback path (retry budget spent) the healthy prefix must still be in hand
 * when the conviction arrives — that is what makes a precise cut possible
 * instead of one that lops the answer off at the provable point. With
 * `holdbackChars: 0` nothing is held and the behaviour is exactly the old
 * aggregate-then-flush, byte for byte.
