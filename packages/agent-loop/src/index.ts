/**
 * `@celestea/agent-loop` — the AgentLoop implementation: turn/step driving,
 * context-budget trimming, cooperative cancellation and the five terminal
 * states, as a plugin over the `core` seams.
 *
 * Dependency direction: agent-loop -> core only. The loop resolves `Llm`,
 * `SessionLog` and `ToolRegistry` from the Context at turn start, so this
 * package never imports a provider, a storage backend or a tool implementation.
 *
 * Module map (legacy -> TS):
 *   loop.ts          DefaultAgentLoop, the step loop            (loop.rs)
 *   step.ts          per-step verdict types + folds             (loop.rs)
 *   seams.ts         Context -> Llm/SessionLog/ToolRegistry      (loop.rs:204-213)
 *   cancel.ts        AbortSignal checkpoints, synth. result text (loop.rs:181-200)
 *   context-trim.ts  token estimate + trim_context              (context.rs)
 *   usage.ts         UsageTracker                               (loop.rs:49-89)
 *   events.ts        LoopEvent builders + EventSink             (events.rs)
 *   thinking.ts      W252 thinking-burst aggregation            (loop.rs:165-171)
 *   repetition.ts    W1510 online degenerate-repetition detector (new)
 *   repetition-recovery.ts W1510 plan, instructions, diagnostics (new)
 *   repetition-cut.ts W1510 what happens to a convicted attempt  (new)
 *   repetition-run.ts W1510 the wrap-up round trip              (new)
 *   perturbation.ts  W1510 the re-issue route perturbation seam  (new)
 *   plugin.ts        AGENT_LOOP_SERVICE registration            (runtime/src/compose.rs)
 *   sse.ts           LoopEvent -> SSE frame mapping             (studio/src/main.rs:667)
 *
 * Public API = this file. Everything else is an internal module.
