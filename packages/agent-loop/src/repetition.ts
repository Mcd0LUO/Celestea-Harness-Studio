/**
 * W1510 — online detection of DEGENERATE REPETITION in a streaming reply.
 * W9331 — realigned with upstream `dsh-guard-repeat-output` 2.1.6 (MIT).
 *
 * The failure mode is real and was observed in production: a DeepSeek-family
 * model generating a long answer collapses into emitting the same sentence
 * hundreds of times ("OK. Let me write. Let me go." xN). The agent loop had no
 * detector at all, so the turn burned tokens until the model stopped on its own
 * or a human hit cancel.
 *
 * This module is PURE and ONLINE: a caller feeds text deltas one at a time and
 * gets back either null (nothing to report) or the evidence of a repetition
 * collapse. It never touches the log, the clock, the network or the Context —
 * loop.ts owns the wiring, this file owns the judgement.
 *
 * ## Provenance: this is a PORT, not a reinvention
 *
 * Upstream package: **`dsh-guard-repeat-output` v2.1.6** (MIT, zero dependencies,
 * published 2026-10-04; <https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-guard-repeat-output>).
 * Upstream file: `index.js`, the "Pure detector" section. Licence requires the
 * origin to be named, and the shape of this file — the absolute evaluation grid,
 * the raw-text window, the two-legged verdict — is upstream's, carried over rather
 * than re-derived.
 *
 * The detector is a port of the host-side plugin dsh-guard-repeat-output
 * (index.js, the "Pure detector" section), which has been running against real
 * traffic. Two of its properties are load-bearing and were carried over
 * VERBATIM rather than re-derived:
 *
 *   1. **The evaluation grid is absolute, not per-delta.** A caller feeds deltas
 *      of arbitrary size; they are sliced so evaluations land on evalEveryChars,
 *      2*evalEveryChars, ... An accumulate-and-reset counter (the obvious
 *      implementation) discards the overshoot, so the evaluation points drift
 *      with the provider SSE framing — and because the judgement is made over a
 *      fixed-size window, the same text can then convict or not convict purely
 *      by accident of chunking. Measured: chunk 3 and chunk 7 missed a real
 *      collapse entirely while chunk 40 convicted it.
 *   2. **The window is bounded on RAW text, and segmentation runs on the raw
 *      window.** Normalizing whitespace first would turn a newline into a space
 *      and silently make the newline in SEGMENT_BREAK dead — a reply repeating
 *      one unpunctuated line would collapse into a single enormous segment and
 *      never reach minSegments. Only the comparison keys are normalized.
 *
 * ## W9331: what the realignment changed, and why it was not a tuning nit
 *
 * This file previously carried a **pre-2.1.6** port whose segmentation dropped
 * every segment shorter than `minSegmentChars` (12). Upstream removed that
 * threshold in 2.1.6 because it stopped a whole class of collapses from being
 * detected at all, and made the failure actively misleading rather than merely
 * silent. Three concrete changes, all in [DEEPSEEK_REPETITION_THRESHOLDS] and
 * [segmentsOf]:
 *
 *   - `minSegmentChars` is **gone**; a segment is kept whenever it carries a
 *     letter or digit, however short, so only bare punctuation is dropped.
 *   - `lowInfoDupShare` 0.85 -> 0.80 (0.85 was tuned against the OLD,
 *     length-filtered statistic; with the corrected segmentation the share is
 *     measured over the same segment set the phrase leg uses).
 *   - `degenerationOnset` now uses the SAME keep-rule, so detection and pruning
 *     judge one segment set.
 *
 * The measured upstream result of the fix: **62/62** frozen collapses,
 * **146/146** live collapses, **0/1708** false positives on legitimate reasoning
 * parts. The previous build caught **0/146** of those live collapses.
 *
 * ## Scope: DeepSeek only, explicitly
 *
 * createRepetitionGuard returns null for every model whose id does not contain
 * "deepseek" (case-insensitive). A false positive on another provider is WORSE
 * than no detection at all: it would abort a healthy turn and spend a recovery
 * round trip instead of answering. The gate is therefore a positive,
 * explicit test on the model id and it fails CLOSED — an unknown or empty model
 * id is not detected.
 *
 * ## What is detected
 *
 * The guard is fed BOTH text and thinking deltas. Covering reasoning is not
 * optional: the production incident this module exists for degenerated ENTIRELY
 * inside reasoning — 142 reasoning parts, the worst repeating one phrase 27,269
 * times across 1,371,962 characters — while all 10 text parts of that same
 * session were healthy (top segment count 1). A text-only guard would not have
 * fired once.
 *
 * Two independent signals must BOTH hold inside one bounded rolling window:
 *
 *   1. **phrase repetition** — the window is built from segments (the raw text
 *      split on sentence terminators). Phrase repetition holds when the longest
 *      run of identical segments reaches phraseRun, OR when one segment accounts
 *      for phraseTopCount occurrences.
 *   2. **low information** — the duplicate share of the window reaches
 *      lowInfoDupShare AND the ratio of distinct character k-grams falls to
 *      maxUniqueGramRatio or below, i.e. saying the same thing in slightly
 *      different words also counts.
 *
 * Requiring BOTH is what makes the detector safe. Either signal alone has a
 * large legitimate population: a report that repeats one command block twelve
 * times is phrase-repetitive, and 14 small functions that each return null score
 * a 0.107 k-gram ratio. Only the combination — very high duplication AND very
 * low novelty — separates a collapse from ordinary repetitive-but-informative
 * output.
 *
 * ## Calibration (why these numbers)
 *
 * Measured over 205 real long assistant rows (>=1200 chars) plus 1708 real
 * legitimate reasoning parts harvested from 60 unrelated sessions, plus
 * hand-built hard negatives:
 *
 *   | signal                        | worst legitimate | smallest degenerate |
 *   |-------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
 *   | duplicate share (segments)    | 0.075            | 0.876               |
 *   | distinct 5-gram ratio         | 0.572            | 0.126               |
 *   | longest identical-segment run | 2                | 2                   |
 *   | top-segment occurrences       | 4                | 45                  |
 *
 * The thresholds sit in the wide gap between those columns — roughly an order of
 * magnitude of margin on the duplication axis and on novelty — rather than a
 * hair. Note the third row: the longest-run column does NOT separate the sets on
 * its own (the same-thing-different-words collapse has no identical run at all),
 * which is exactly why the phrase leg also accepts a dominant top segment and
 * why the low-information leg exists.
 *
 * The reasoning corpus is the load-bearing negative: reasoning text is naturally
 * MORE repetitive than prose (it restates its own premises while thinking), so
 * thresholds that were safe only on text would be unsafe in practice. All 1708
 * legitimate reasoning parts stay clean at these values.
 *
 * maxUniqueGramRatio is deliberately far from the boundary — measured separation
 * is 0.126 vs 0.572, so any value in 0.2-0.5 behaves identically; it is pinned at
 * 0.30 to keep the gate meaningful rather than tuned to noise. The window (2400
 * chars) holds ~80 short segments — the shape of the real incident — while
 * staying short enough that legitimate prose cannot fill it.
 *
 * ### Known boundary (deliberate, documented)
 *
 * A block of >=24 byte-identical long lines with no surrounding prose — e.g. a
 * test body that is 40 identical expect(result.ok).toBe(true); lines — is
 * convicted. Content-wise it is indistinguishable from a collapse: it carries no
 * new information per line. That is accepted because (a) real assistant answers
 * wrap such blocks in prose, and one prose sentence per block keeps the window
 * clean, and (b) the consequence of a false positive is bounded and recoverable
 * (the turn ends interrupted with a wrap-up round trip instead of an answer).
 * The detector is not claimed to be perfect; it is claimed to be safe on real
 * text.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * O(windowChars) time and memory per evaluation, and an evaluation runs only
 * every evalEveryChars characters — so a 100 KB answer costs ~500 evaluations
 * over a constant-size buffer, never a full-text rescan. Nothing is retained
 * beyond the window.

 * detector would have coupled two judgements that are correct for different
 * reasons. See `repetition-sanitize.ts` and `repetition-cleanup.ts`.
