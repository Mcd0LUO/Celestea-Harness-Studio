/**
 * DefaultAgentLoop — port of `crates/agent-loop/src/loop.rs`.
 *
 * One turn = one user message + N model steps. Per step the loop:
 *   1. derives the model-visible history from the session log (the log is the
 *      only source of truth) and trims it to the context budget;
 *   2. asks the `Llm` seam for a stream and consumes text / thinking / usage
 *      deltas, aggregating reasoning bursts into one persisted row;
 *   3. appends the authoritative assistant reply, or dispatches the step's
 *      tool calls through the `ToolRegistry` seam (all `tool_call` rows first,
 *      then one `tool_result` per call, in model order);
 *   4. appends whatever arrived while the turn was RUNNING — a user
 *      interjection or a worker receipt — to the log at the step boundary,
 *      right before the next model call (W513), so the running turn receives it
 *      without being interrupted and without a second turn being started;
 *   5. repeats until the model answers without tool calls, the step budget is
 *      exhausted, the turn is cancelled, or the stream fails.
 *
 * Every started turn ends with EXACTLY ONE `turn_end` — in the log and on the
 * event stream, written from a single exit point — carrying one of the five
 * real terminal states: completed / cancelled / error / step_limit /
 * interrupted. A torn stream, an exhausted budget or a cancellation is never
 * reported as `completed`.
 *
 * Cancellation is cooperative over an [AbortSignal] and re-checked at every
 * await checkpoint (before generating, while streaming, between tool batches).
 * When a tool batch is abandoned, every unanswered call of the step gets a
 * synthesized cancelled `tool_result`, so the log stays protocol-valid.
