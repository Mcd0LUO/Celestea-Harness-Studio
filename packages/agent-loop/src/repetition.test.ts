/**
 * W1510 — degenerate-repetition detector tests.
 *
 * Two things are being pinned here, and the second matters more than the first:
 *
 *  1. the detector FIRES on every real degenerate shape (phrase repetition and
 *     "same thing in different words" low-information repetition);
 *  2. the detector does NOT fire on legitimate repetitive-but-informative
 *     output — repeated `return null;` across functions, repeated assertions,
 *     repeated stack traces, repeated table rows, and long normal prose.
 *     A false positive aborts a healthy turn, so it is worse than a miss.
