/**
 * W1510 — what happens to the text of a convicted attempt, ported from the host
 * plugin `dsh-guard-repeat-output`.
 *
 * The detector says WHEN a stream collapsed. The driver decides WHICH arm runs
 * (see `repetition-recovery.ts`). This module owns the third question — what
 * happens to the characters — and it is separate because that question needs
 * both the stream outcome and the reasoning buffer, and because the loop is at
 * its size ceiling.
 *
 * ## The two arms
 *
 *   DISCARD  — the attempt produced nothing usable, so nothing is written. The
 *              reasoning burst is dropped WITHOUT a row, which is the only way a
 *              1.4 MB degenerate `thinking_delta` can be prevented.
 *   TRUNCATE — the attempt began healthily and then collapsed. The prefix before
 *              the onset is KEPT (it is real work) and only the degeneration is
 *              dropped, so the turn ends with something useful instead of
 *              nothing.
 *
 * ## Why the onset is searched, not assumed
 *
 * The detector can only convict once enough repetition accumulated, so the
 * conviction point LAGS the true onset — measured on the ported corpus, by
 * 1700-3600 characters. Cutting at the conviction point would release exactly
 * that much degenerate text into the log. `degenerationOnset` walks back to
 * where the repetition actually began, which is what makes the cut precise.
