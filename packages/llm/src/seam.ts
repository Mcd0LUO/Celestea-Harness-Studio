/**

 * A1 (W746): the seam vocabulary is CORE's. `@celestea/core` is the single
 * source of `Llm` / `Message` / `Content` / `Role` / `ToolCall` / `ToolSpec` /
 * `ModelRequest` / `Usage` / `LlmError`, and this module re-exports it instead
 * of redeclaring a second, structurally-identical universe. The old
 * `TODO(core-seam)` ("core's seam is still in flight") is discharged: core has
 * exported all of these since W271, and `packages/llm` now imports core.
 *
 * Field names and content tag names are contract, not style (`type` +
 * `content`, `tool_call_id`, flat usage counters): do not rename anything.
 *
 * ONE member cannot be a pure re-export — see [StreamEvent].

/**
 * `StreamEvent` — core's streamed-turn union with exactly ONE member widened.
 *
 * A provider's SSE idle guard is a terminal `failed{kindOf:"timeout"}` (the
 * legacy engine's `StreamEvent::Failed { kind, .. }` carried a free-form kind,
 * whose live values were "stream" and "timeout"), while core's union lists
 * "generate" | "stream".
 *
 * TODO(core-timeout-kind) — why the widening stays HERE for now: folding it
 * into core needs three files this cut may not touch or must not change:
 *   1. `contracts/session-event.schema.json` freezes `TurnOutcome.error.kind`
 *      to exactly ["generate","stream"], and W744 EXECUTES that schema
 *      (`tests/contract-parity.test.ts:68,119`): widening core's
 *      `TurnOutcome.error.kind` would let the engine mint rows the frozen
 *      contract rejects;
 *   2. `packages/agent-loop/src/step.ts:49` forwards `kindOf` into
 *      `TurnOutcome.error.kind` verbatim, so `StreamEvent.failed.kindOf`
 *      cannot be widened alone (agent-loop is W747's file);
 *   3. `contracts/` is frozen — a real widening is a contract change with a
 *      decision record, not a worker's bounded cut.
 * Until then the delta is this single member: everything else is derived from
 * core's union, so a variant added in core appears here automatically.
 *
 * W2017 adds a SECOND widening, for the same reason and with the same shape:
 * core's `done` is `{ kind, message }` and cannot carry the provider's own
 * `finish_reason`, so a turn the provider cut off on the token cap
 * (`finish_reason:"length"`) used to be indistinguishable from a finished one —
 * an HTTP 200, a half sentence, and no hint anywhere.
 *
 *   { kind: "done"; message: Message; truncated?: true }
 *
 * `truncated` is OPTIONAL and its type is the literal `true`, never `boolean`:
 *   * absent  = the provider reported no truncation (every provider that never
 *               sends `finish_reason`, and every ordinary `"stop"` turn) — the
 *               event is byte-identical to what this seam produced before, so
 *               no existing consumer can observe a difference;
 *   * `true`  = the provider reported `finish_reason:"length"`; whatever arrived
 *               is a PREFIX, and a half-written tool-call argument is a string.
 * A `false` value is deliberately unrepresentable: it would put a new key on
 * every ordinary turn and make "not truncated" a payload change.
 *
 * Producers: `stream.ts` (the only place the wire is read). It rides through
 * `retry.ts` / `fallback.ts` untouched because both forward the terminal event
 * verbatim, so the fact survives a re-issued or re-targeted turn.
