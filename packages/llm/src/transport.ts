/**
 * HTTP transport for the streaming request (P2a).
 *
 * Owns the two pre-stream guards of the three-tier timeout contract:
 *   * connect timeout      — the TCP/TLS handshake must complete in time;
 *   * response-header time — send() -> response headers must arrive in time.
 * Beyond the headers the body is guarded per chunk by the stream idle timeout
 * (see stream.ts). There is deliberately NO total-request timeout, so a long
 * generation is never killed by a pre-stream guard.
 *
 * The API key rides only in the request's Authorization header; error messages
 * carry the HTTP status plus a body snippet, never a credential.
