/**
 * The engine's `derive_messages` projection — a 1:1 port of
 * `crates/session/src/log.rs:73-204`.
 *
 * A2 (W746): this algorithm lives in CORE, not in the L1 implementation
 * package. `SessionLog.deriveMessages()` is a seam method, so the projection
 * has to be part of the seam: an implementation that returns `[]` (or that
 * re-implements the rules slightly differently) is a silent history loss, not
 * an "alternative implementation". `@celestea/session` re-exports these
 * functions; backends built with [projectingSessionLog] get them for free.
 *
 * Rules (all of them are contract, each pinned by a unit test):
 *   - `TurnStart` / `TurnEnd` are structural markers, never projected;
 *   - `ThinkingDelta` is replay-only decoration (W252), never projected;
 *   - `ToolCall` rows are ACCUMULATED, not projected: consecutive calls merge
 *     into ONE assistant message carrying one `tool_call` content per call
 *     (LLM protocols require all tool calls of a turn in a single message);
 *   - the accumulator is flushed before any other event, and after the last
 *     event;
 *   - rows with `parent_id` (W255 run_code sub-calls) stay in the log for
 *     audit/replay but never reach the model: both the call and its result are
 *     skipped — the outer run_code round trip is all the model sees;
 *   - `ToolResult` projects to a tool message whose text is `"Error: {err}"`
 *     when the error is a non-empty string, otherwise the serde_json text of
 *     the value (`"null"` when absent).
 *
 * `balance_tool_calls` (W267) then makes the projection protocol-valid: every
 * assistant tool_calls message must be followed by one tool message per call.
