/**
 * Tool + ToolGuard seams — port of `crates/core/src/tool.rs`.
 *
 * A guard is the "waterfall" step of dispatch: it may Allow, Deny or Ask, and
 * the first non-Allow decision short-circuits the chain. The registry runs the
 * guard chain and then the tool, capturing errors instead of throwing.
 *
 * `ToolDecision` keeps the P0 TS shape (`{kind:"allow"}` / `{kind:"deny",reason}`
 * / `{kind:"ask",reason}`) declared in `./types.ts` — it is the contract the
 * tools package and the API surface already use, and it is the same three
 * variants as the engine's enum.

   * dispatched kept running: the loop stopped *awaiting* it and the child
   * process it spawned went on to finish its side effects. The loop logged the
   * honest "execution may have completed" (see `CANCELLED_EXECUTION_UNCERTAIN`),
   * which is a true statement about an unacceptable situation.
   *
   * Why it is safe to add here even though core is L0 and contracts are frozen:
   *   * `AbortSignal` is a GLOBAL type (lib.dom / node globals) — this adds no
   *     import, so no dependency edge appears in either direction;
   *   * it is OPTIONAL, so every existing producer of a `ToolInput` literal
   *     (tests, tools, the run_code sub-call bridge) still type-checks unchanged;
   *   * the field is never serialized — it is a runtime handle, not a contract
   *     key, and `ToolInput` is not part of the frozen wire contracts
   *     (`contracts/` describes the session/HTTP schemas, not this seam type).
   *
   * A tool that ignores it keeps its exact previous behaviour; a tool that
   * spawns a process SHOULD abort it. The loop is the only producer that sets it.
