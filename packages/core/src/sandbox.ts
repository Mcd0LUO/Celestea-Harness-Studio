/**
 * Sandbox seam — the injected execution boundary behind `run_shell`.
 *
 * Parity target: `crates/tools/src/sandbox.rs` (`SandboxConfig`, `SandboxMeta`,
 * `SandboxOutput`, `SandboxError`, `execute_sandboxed`, `spawn_sandboxed`) plus
 * the `OsSandboxLayer` hook that lets an OS-level layer (bubblewrap / raw
 * namespaces / seccomp) wrap the direct command without touching call sites.
 *
 * Why a seam in `core`: `run_shell` must be pure orchestration (argument
 * handling, timeout/cap bookkeeping, background hand-off) and must never know
 * *how* isolation is achieved. Implementations are plugins: P2b ships the
 * userspace implementation in `@celestea/tools`; the real OS isolation lands in
 * P2c behind this exact interface (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1, §7.4).
 *
 * Invariants kept from the legacy engine:
 * - the effective isolation mode travels *inside* every result (`SandboxMeta`):
 *   a caller never infers the isolation level, and silent degradation stays
 *   visible;
 * - **the provider declares its own completeness** (W1483): the fact booleans
 *   say what is in force, `SandboxMeta.enforcement` says whether that covers
 *   *every* effect the mode promises, and `promise_gaps` names what is missing.
 *   A consumer needing an absolute boundary refuses a `partial` run instead of
 *   re-deriving the answer from the booleans;
 * - every failure is a structured `SandboxError` — `run_shell-sandbox: code=<k>
 *   msg="<quoted>"` — never a bare string, never a thrown non-Error;
 * - a kill deadline is enforced for foreground runs; background runs carry no
 *   call-level deadline (they outlive the turn) and are reaped by the caller.
