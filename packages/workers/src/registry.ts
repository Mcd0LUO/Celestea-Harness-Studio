/**
 * WorkerRegistry — the in-memory + `registry.tsv` state of every worker this
 * process owns, plus the seams that make a worker drivable (W185/W232/W248).
 *
 * Shape of the state:
 *   - `entries`  Memoized view of the tsv table. Rows written by THIS process
 *                carry a `proc=<pid>` token; rows from another process (or
 *                legacy rows with no `proc` at all) are foreign and never show up
 *                in the status view as ours (W234).
 *   - `sessions` Addressable conversations (`session-<n>`, the host id, …).
 *   - `mailbox`  Per-session FIFO queues with wake-up semantics.
 *   - `drivers`  The three driver seams, attached by the composition root after
 *                the Llm/ToolRegistry/AgentLoop services exist (so a spawn is
 *                background-driven instead of merely registered).
 *
 * Lifecycle (W736): a row is born RUNNING and is settled exactly once, by
 * [finalize] — the single terminal write point (DONE / FAILED plus `ended_at`
 * and, on failure, `fail=<reason>`), reached through the same atomic tmp+rename
 * path as every other row write. The in-band writers are the receipt protocol
 * ([closeLoop]: the brief turn's verdict), the driver's exit ([driverExited]:
 * the session vanished or the loop was stopped) and a stopping host
 * ([shutdown]); the out-of-band adjudicator for rows that have no driver left is
 * the independent watchdog (`watchdog.ts`, the sole owner of liveness
 * judgement). A terminal row is frozen.
 *
 * No strong cycle: the three worker tools hold a [WeakRef] to this registry
 * (tools.ts), the drivers hold only core seams, and [release] drops everything —
 * so a hot-swapped generation can actually be collected (W248).
 *
 * `tsvPath = null` keeps the whole table in memory (tests, ephemeral hosts).
