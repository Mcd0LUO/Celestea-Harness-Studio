/**
 * `run_code` — programmatic tool execution with a parent broker (W255;
 * TypeScript since W774, `crates/tools/src/run_code.rs`).
 *
 * One call = one round trip: the program runs under the *same* sandbox as
 * `run_shell`, its `tools.<name>(...)` bridge calls travel to this process as
 * one-line JSON on stdout, and each one is dispatched through the identical
 * `ToolRegistry` pipeline (schema → guards → execute) before the reply goes
 * back on stdin. The model sees only `main()`'s return value; the intermediate
 * rows stay in the session log as nested `ToolCall`/`ToolResult` events
 * (`id = "<parent>:c<n>"`, `parent_id = <parent>`), which `deriveMessages`
 * skips.
 *
 * Wiring is late-bound on purpose ([`RegistryHandle`]): the tool must be
 * registered *into* the registry it will dispatch through, so the handle is
 * bound right after registration (the `RegistryHandle` / `run_code_tool_with_handle`).
