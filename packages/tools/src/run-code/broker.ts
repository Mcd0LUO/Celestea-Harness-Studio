/**
 * The `run_code` parent broker (`crates/tools/src/run_code.rs:562-978`).
 *
 * One `run_code` call = one round trip. The assembled program — TypeScript by
 * default since W774, Python on request — runs in the sandbox; its sub-calls
 * arrive as one-line JSON on stdout and the parent answers on stdin after
 * dispatching each one through the **same** registry pipeline (schema → guards →
 * execute) the model itself would use. Only `main()`'s return value travels back
 * as the tool result.
 *
 * The protocol is language-neutral (it is byte-identical for both SDKs), so the
 * language only decides two things: the script file's extension and the
 * interpreter that runs it.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - every limit is enforced here, never in the child: the 21st sub-call is
 *   refused before dispatch, the wall clock is enforced while waiting for a
 *   line, the sub-call output ledger is charged per reply;
 * - every infrastructure failure is a structured `run_code: code=… msg="…"`
 *   (invalid_arg | registry | config | spawn | protocol | timeout | cpu_exceeded
 *   | aborted); `cpu_exceeded` is the §3.3 addition that makes a child killed by
 *   its own `RLIMIT_CPU` self-describing instead of a bare `aborted`;
 *   a program exception is that exception's text plus a bounded log tail;
 * - the child is killed on timeout, on cancel and on protocol failure — never
 *   left behind — and its script file is removed on every exit path.
