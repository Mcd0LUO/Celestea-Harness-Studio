/**
 * `exposedRegistry` — the MODEL-VISIBLE face of one session's tool registry.
 *
 * `docs/modes-standard-vs-execution.md` §5.2 #1/#2 (P1): in `execution` mode the
 * four SDK-covered tools (`read_file` / `write_file` / `list_dir` / `run_shell`)
 * are no longer offered for a DIRECT call — they are reached from inside a
 * `run_code` program. The engine's registry keeps every tool registered; what
 * changes is the face the model sees and the door a model-initiated call knocks
 * on.
 *
 * Two invariants make this a decorator and not a second registry:
 *
 * 1. **The verdict never lies** (`registry.ts`, W738 P1): a folded call is
 *    REFUSED before anything runs, so it is reported as a `deny` whose reason is
 *    the very text the caller sees — never an `allow` for a call the seam
 *    declined to execute.
 * 2. **`run_code` sub-calls are NOT folded** (§5.2 #2, M8): the `run_code` tool
 *    holds a `RegistryHandle` bound to the INNER registry (`plugin.ts`), and this
 *    decorator is only ever the Context-provided face. A program's
 *    `tools.read_file(...)` therefore rides the inner pipeline unchanged —
 *    nothing here inspects the `:c<n>` id shape of a sub-call.
 *
 * `register` / `addGuard` / `get` pass straight through: the decorator never
 * owns tools or guards, it only filters what is LISTED and gates what is
 * DISPATCHED BY NAME from the model side.
 *
 * W806 (P0) adds the second, dynamic layer without adding a second decorator:
 * `hidden` may be a LIVE PROVIDER, `order` fixes the wire order to a stable
 * disclosure order, and `onHidden` lets a policy remember a refused direct call.
 * See `disclosure.ts` for the policy itself. Nothing about the mode fold or the
 * `run_code` escape hatch changes.

 * `ask_user_question`, a future orchestration tool) must be *decided* about
 * rather than silently inherited by both modes. Anything outside it is folded —
 * which is why the execution face is exactly these eight names (M7).
 *
 * W884 adds `load_skill` to the keep list. It is a PURE READ of the session's
 * own skill layers (no writes, no process, no network), and — unlike the four
 * SDK-covered tools — it is NOT reachable from a `run_code` program
 * (`SDK_TOOLS` exposes only read_file / write_file / list_dir / run_shell).
 * Folding it would therefore make skills UNREACHABLE in execution mode while the
 * turn-start catalog still advertises them: a prompt that lies about what the
 * model can do, which §6.5 of the disclosure design forbids. Keeping it costs
 * one schema and preserves progressive disclosure in both modes.

 * the whole request prefix from token 0 (design §3.4/P4).
 *

 * (W9). It is an INTERSECTION applied AFTER the fold — never a union — so a name
 * the mode already folded cannot be restored and a name outside the folded face
 * simply has no effect. Callers that read the same face as a composed instance
