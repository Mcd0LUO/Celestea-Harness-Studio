/**
 * Sandbox configuration and spawn plumbing for the userspace implementation
 * (`crates/tools/src/sandbox.rs`, v1 userspace path).
 *
 * Everything an operator can tune is an env knob, read once per sandbox
 * construction; the child environment is an **allowlist**, never the whole host
 * environment.
 *
 * ## B5-06 · what "never HOME" does and does not promise
 *
 * The old header here made a TWO-part claim about `HOME` and the credential
 * directories under it: that the variable is deliberately never forwarded, and
 * that this in turn keeps the credential directories out of the child. The first
 * part held; the second did not. This section keeps the part that is true and
 * states the part that is not — with the measurement that settles both:
 *
 *   · **`HOME` is not in the allowlist — TRUE, and it stays that way.**
 *     `ENV_ALLOWLIST` (POSIX) and `ENV_ALLOWLIST_WIN32` both omit it, and
 *     `sanitizedEnv` never adds it. Measured: the exact map handed to a Windows
 *     child is `{PATH, PATHEXT…, SystemRoot, ComSpec, TEMP, TMP, USERPROFILE,
 *     HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH, APPDATA, …}` — no `HOME`.
 *
 *   · **"the credential directories are thereby kept out of the child" — FALSE as
 *     written, and the fix is THIS COMMENT, not the allowlist.** Two independent
 *     reasons:
 *       1. A SHELL may synthesise the variable. Measured on this host (Windows,
 *          gitbash is the resolved shell): with `HOME` absent from the child env,
 *          `$HOME` still prints `/c/Users/lenovo`. So "we did not pass it" is not
 *          observable from inside the shell, and a comment claiming otherwise
 *          sends the next reader looking for a leak that is not in this list.
 *       2. More fundamentally, the userspace path has **no mount boundary** —
 *          `ls -d ~` resolves to the real home and the directory is readable
 *          whether or not the variable is set. Env shaping was never a
 *          confidentiality boundary here; the OS-isolated provider's
 *          `--ro-bind` / masks are (see bwrap-argv.ts).
 *
 * So: **credential DIRECTORIES are out of scope for the env allowlist on the
 * userspace path, by design and by documentation.** If that is to change, the
 * lever is the sandbox provider (a mask or a namespace), not this list. Dropping
 * `HOME` from the allowlist would also break ordinary tooling on POSIX, where
 * npm/git/curl resolve `~` from it — the leak it looks like it closes is closed
 * by nothing.

 * W9112: the interpreter env that makes a PYTHON child speak UTF-8.
 *
 * Root cause of the silent data corruption this fixes (measured, Windows 11 /
 * Python 3.11): with no env, a Python child on Windows inherits the ANSI code
 * page — `sys.stdout.encoding == sys.stdin.encoding == "gbk"`, and
 * `locale.getpreferredencoding(False) == "cp936"`. The `run_code` protocol is
 * UTF-8 on the wire in BOTH directions, so:
 *
 * - the child writes GBK bytes to stdout, the broker decodes them as UTF-8
 *   (`safeUtf8`) and every Chinese character silently becomes U+FFFD — the JSON
 *   frame stays valid, so `error === null` and the corruption is invisible;
 * - the parent writes UTF-8 bytes to the child's stdin, Python decodes them as
 *   GBK, and `tools.read_file` answers mojibake (the opposite direction, same
 *   root cause);
 * - a character GBK cannot encode (emoji) raises `UnicodeEncodeError` instead.
 *
 * `PYTHONUTF8=1` is Python's official UTF-8 Mode (3.7+). It is the variable
 * chosen over `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` because it fixes the WHOLE interpreter
 * and not only the three stdio streams (both measured):
 *
 * | `sys.stdout.encoding` | `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)` | bare `open(p, "w")` bytes |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | (nothing)              | `gbk` | `cp936` | GBK — corrupt |
 * | `PYTHONIOENCODING`     | `utf-8` | `cp936` | **GBK — still corrupt** |
 * | `PYTHONUTF8=1`         | `utf-8` | `utf-8` | UTF-8 |
 *
 * A program that writes its own file with plain `open()` is exactly the
 * "题库" case that was corrupted, so the stdio-only variable would have left the
 * most damaging path broken. UTF-8 Mode also sets `sys.flags.utf8_mode == 1`,
 * which is the honest, machine-checkable statement of "this child is UTF-8".
 *
 * Scope of the side effects (why this is safe): only a Python interpreter reads
 * the variable, so it is a no-op for a Node child and for `run_shell` commands;
 * and on POSIX `python3` already runs in UTF-8 mode, so a Linux/macOS child's
 * environment and behaviour are byte-for-byte unchanged. It is injected for
 * EVERY Windows sandbox child rather than only the `run_code` Python one
 * because the whole tools layer is UTF-8 end to end: a nested `python` launched
 * through `run_shell` hits the identical corruption, and leaving it on the ANSI
 * code page while the broker speaks UTF-8 would only move the bug one layer
 * down. See [windowsUtf8Env] for the pure seam and [sanitizedEnv] for how the
 * value reaches the child.
